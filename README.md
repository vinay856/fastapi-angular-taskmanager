Task Manager Application
This is a simple full-stack Task Manager (To-Do List) application built with FastAPI for the backend API and Angular 17+ for the frontend user interface.

🚀 Technologies Used
Backend:

Python: Programming language.

FastAPI: Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs, based on standard Python type hints.

Pydantic: Used by FastAPI for data validation and serialization.

Uvicorn: An ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.

SQLAlchemy (or in-memory for this example): For database interaction (though the initial example uses an in-memory list for simplicity, it's designed for easy database integration).

Frontend:

Angular 17+: A powerful framework for building single-page applications, leveraging standalone components for a streamlined development experience.

TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.

RxJS: Used for reactive programming and handling asynchronous operations (e.g., HTTP requests).

HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.

✨ Features
Add New Tasks: Create new to-do items with a title and optional description.

View Tasks: Display a list of all tasks.

Mark as Complete: Toggle the completion status of a task.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.

📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8+: Download from python.org.

pip: Python's package installer (comes with Python).

Node.js (LTS version recommended): Download from nodejs.org.

npm: Node Package Manager (comes with Node.js).

Angular CLI:

npm install -g @angular/cli

⚙️ Setup and Running the Project
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/fastapi-angular-taskmanager.git
cd fastapi-angular-taskmanager

(Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username and adjust the repository name if it's different)

2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)
Navigate into the backend directory, set up a virtual environment, and install dependencies.

cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (Command Prompt):
# venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# On Windows (PowerShell):
# venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# If requirements.txt is not present, install manually:
# pip install fastapi uvicorn "pydantic[email]" python-multipart

Run the FastAPI Backend Server:

uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

The backend server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Keep this terminal open.

3. Frontend Setup (Angular)
Open a new terminal window, navigate into the frontend directory, and install its dependencies.

cd ../frontend # Go back to the root, then into frontend
# Or if in a new terminal:
# cd fastapi-angular-taskmanager/frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

Run the Angular Frontend Development Server:

ng serve --open

The Angular development server will start and automatically open your browser to http://localhost:4200.

🚀 Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200.

You will see the Task Manager application.

Use the form to add new tasks.

Interact with the tasks to mark them complete or delete them.

The Angular frontend will communicate with the FastAPI backend to manage your tasks.

☁️ Deployment Notes
To deploy this application to a live environment:

Frontend (Angular): Build the application using ng build --configuration production. The resulting static files in the dist/frontend folder can be hosted on any static site hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages for static content only).

Backend (FastAPI): The FastAPI application can be deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Heroku, Google Cloud Run, AWS EC2/ECS) using Docker containers with Uvicorn/Gunicorn.

CORS: Ensure that the CORSMiddleware in your FastAPI main.py is configured with the correct production URL(s) of your deployed Angular frontend.

API URL: Update the apiUrl in frontend/src/app/services/task.service.ts to point to the public URL of your deployed FastAPI backend.
